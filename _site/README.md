# My new website
### my newest experiment: creating a Jekyll-based site (and preparing it to act as a blog as well), handling the asset pipeline with Gulp.

## Basic structure and functions

The main purpose of this website is to try and explore Jekyll as much as I can for creating and managing content. The goal for the repo is to be modular, easily configurable and managable.


### 1. Basics

I'll use collections, data files (YAML and JSON, or even CSV), some _dynamic layouts_ (whatever this means...) and a modular SCSS structure.


### 2. pushState

I'm trying to incorporate a really smooth user experience for the site, so I've chosen __smoothState.js__ and __pace.js__ for basics. Later, these will be replaced something of my own, but for the time they are more than perfect for the goal.
    
### 3. Further plans

- blogging module
- all content into JSON files
- an own "white label CMS" for editing JSON files and handling the whole structure
- multiple Gulp tasks for dev, test, prod environments

Cheers!
